#Week 3

##Monday
*Event handlers and listeners
talked about implementing event handlers and listeners in javascript in order to capture information from user input fields
primarily used forms as the example
example code link: https://codesandbox.io/s/RgrPQzj1R
*Testing
how to write basic tests to make sure functions work as intended

##Tuesday
*filter, map, reduce
non destructive (doesnt hurt original array) vs destructive (changes the original array)

when we get to redux, not hurting original copies of data is beneficial

##Wedsnesday

how to use and test the spread operator to add/remove objects from an array

##Thursday
*Started to combined the last few days of topics into a usable format that is used in the lego site project
*Started the lego site from scratch, got react, materila ui, taptouchplugin, etc all set up
talked about to arrange the filter/map/reduce cycle and implement it into the lego site
*regexp as a language to help filter our results so that it is NOT case sensitive
*regexp allows our code to filter down to return all results as u type a phrase.
ex.. 'e' would return all results containing an e, then when u added another letter to the user input string like 'm'
it will filter results 'em'
*the '^' means starts with, using this with the $(value) makes the search look at the first letter of things rather than all letters

##Friday
*getters
get fullName(){
}
used to retrieve the value of of a variable that was created in the constructor

*setters
used to assign logic to a value before you assign a variable to that value
set Age(value){
  if(value <0){
    
  }
}
