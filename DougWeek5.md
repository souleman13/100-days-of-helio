## Week 5

# Wednesday   

* Redux pattern
* Action - an object that must have 'type' attribute that can be anything u name it, can be anything, a buttonclick, mouse click, etc
* Reducer - facilitates change to the state / applications data. does this is spread operator (...)
* store - saves data
* can use this pattern without react


## Action
* action creator - fn that creates a action object - useful but unneccesary because it can be created inline, within a dispatch
* dispatch - fires/invokes/triggers an action - receives an action object that can be passed to other FNs
## Reducer
* State - current data information that an application can see - Immutable/Read-only
* oeprates on states, changes state, always returns the new state
## Store
* think of it as one giant object full of objects
* holds all the data used by child components of the application
* god-object
